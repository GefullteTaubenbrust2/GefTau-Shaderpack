# GefTau Shaderpack for Minetest
This pack is intended to improve Minetest's visuals by modifying its shader code. The pack adds the following effects:
- Better Shadow/artificial Light Colors
- Color Grading
- Translucent Foliage
- Glossy water
- God Rays
  
Some of these effects are somewhat heavy on the GPU and I will soon add easy options to disable them. The nice thing about Minetest shaders is that you can modify them easily without having to compile the rest of the game. However, this also means that they have to work with what the engine provides. There are certainly other effects or better ways of implementing the ones provided, but that would require changes to the game's source code, however small they may be.
# Installation
1. Download the provided files
2. Go to your Minetest folder
3. Go to `client/shaders`
5. Copy the shaderpack into that folder
6. Profit!

If you want to uninstall, either download the default shaders from [the Minetest repository](https://github.com/minetest/minetest) or create a backup of your current shaders and copy whichever you chose into the `client/shaders` folder.
